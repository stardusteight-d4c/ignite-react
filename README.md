# Event Platform | GraphQL, Apollo Client & Hygraph

![banner](banner.png)

> Project carried out at `Ignite Lab | React.js`, an event held by Rocketseat where we experiment and test new technologies that are
> market trends. This time we built an `Events Platform`, where people will be able to sign up and see the Lessons that are made available
> on specific days and times of the month, the application is integrated with a `Content Management System, Hygraph`, to manage the content of classes
> of the event, as well as its participants. Requests are made with `GraphQL` (a query language created by Facebook), and with `Apollo
> Client` we optimize state management and use it to fetch, cache and modify application data while updating
> automatically your UI.
